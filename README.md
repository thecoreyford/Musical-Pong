# Musical-Pong
**----------Created around Nov 2017----------**

## Description
* A version of the classic game pong, made using JUCE.
* This was created as an entry within a hackathon for a sponsored ticket to the ADC conference 2017.

## Hackathon Brief
* The brief for the hackathon was...
* *"Design and develop a JUCE application (or plugin) that interprets a non-audio input (file or live stream) as sound or music in a creative way. The sonic output of your software should be in some way derived from a source not traditionally related to producing sound or music, which might include (but is not limited to) images, photos, video, text files, MS Office documents, arbitrary binary data (including random memory access), network streams, stock indices, etc."*
